---

### Phase 2: Register Your App (1 hour)

#### 2.1 Create App in Developer Portal

1. Go to: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/developer/dashboard
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Fill in details:

   ```

4. Upload icon (create 144x144 PNG)
5. Submit for approval

6. **IMPORTANT:** Copy your **App ID** (format: `abc123def456`)

---

#### 2.2 Update App ID in Code

Edit `garmin-companion-app/manifest.xml`:
```xml
<!-- Line 3: Replace YOUR_APP_ID_HERE with your actual App ID -->
<iq:application ... id="YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID_HERE" ...>
```

---

### Phase 3: Build the Watch App (3-5 days)

#### 3.1 Create Project in IDE

**VS Code:**
```bash
cd /Users/danieljohnston/AndroidStudioProjects/AiRunCoach
mkdir -p garmin-companion-app
cd garmin-companion-app

# The files I created are already here!
```

**Create missing resource files:**

1. Create `resources/strings.xml`:
```xml
<strings>
    <string id="AppName">AI Run Coach</string>
</strings>
```

2. Create `resources/layouts/layouts.xml`:
```xml
<layouts>
    <layout id="StartLayout">
        <!-- Layout for start screen -->
    </layout>
    <layout id="RunLayout">
        <!-- Layout for run screen -->
    </layout>
</layouts>
```

3. Create `resources/menus/menus.xml`:
```xml
<menus>
    <menu id="RunMenu">
        <menu-item id="finish">Finish Run</menu-item>
    </menu>
</menus>
```

4. Add launcher icon at `resources/drawables/launcher_icon.png` (144x144)

---

#### 3.2 Implement Missing Features

The core structure is done, but you'll need to add:

1. **Settings Screen** (configure max HR, coaching preferences)
2. **Audio Playback** (play coaching from backend)
3. **Data Field Layouts** (polish the UI)
4. **Error Handling** (network failures, GPS loss)
5. **Battery Optimization** (reduce update frequency when idle)

**Estimated time: 3-5 days of development**

---

#### 3.3 Build & Test on Simulator

**Build the app:**
```bash
cd /Users/danieljohnston/AndroidStudioProjects/AiRunCoach/garmin-companion-app

monkeyc \
  -o bin/AiRunCoach.prg \
  -f monkey.jungle \
  -y developer_key.der \
  -w
```

**Run on simulator:**
```bash
connectiq  # Opens Connect IQ simulator
# File → Load Device → fenix7
# File → Load App → Select bin/AiRunCoach.prg
```

---

#### 3.4 Test on Real Device

**Enable Developer Mode on Watch:**
1. On watch: Settings → System → About
2. Tap the top number 5 times
3. Developer Mode enabled!

**Install app:**
```bash
# Connect watch via USB
monkeydo bin/AiRunCoach.prg fenix7
```

---

### Phase 4: Backend Integration Testing (2-3 days)

#### 4.1 Test Authentication Flow

**Watch app needs to authenticate via phone:**

1. User opens watch app
2. Watch displays: "Open phone app to connect"
3. User opens Android app
4. Android app generates auth token for watch
5. Token stored on watch via Garmin's app storage
6. Watch authenticates with backend

**Flow to implement:**
```kotlin
// Android: Generate companion auth token
POST /api/garmin-companion/auth
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "deviceId": "watch_unique_id"
}

Response:
{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN_HERE",
  "userId": "user123"
}

// Store token on watch via Garmin's storage API
```

---

#### 4.2 Test Real-Time Data Streaming

**Test checklist:**
- [ ] Watch streams HR every second
- [ ] Backend receives data (check database)
- [ ] Android app displays watch data on map
- [ ] Coaching triggers at 1km milestone
- [ ] Watch receives coaching text
- [ ] Audio plays on watch

---

#### 4.3 Test Complete Run Flow

1. **Start Run on Watch** → Session created on backend
2. **Run 1 km** → AI coaching triggers
3. **HR enters Zone 4** → HR coaching triggers
4. **Pause Run** → Data streaming pauses
5. **Resume Run** → Data streaming resumes
6. **Finish Run** → Data syncs to backend, run saved

---

### Phase 5: Polish & Publish (1 week)

#### 5.1 UI Polish
- [ ] Design custom data fields
- [ ] Add background colors for HR zones
- [ ] Smooth animations
- [ ] Handle all button combinations
- [ ] Test on multiple watch models

#### 5.2 Create Screenshots for Store
- [ ] Start screen
- [ ] Active run with HR
- [ ] Coaching display
- [ ] Post-run summary
- [ ] Settings screen

#### 5.3 Write Store Description

}
```

#### 6.3 Show Prompt After First Garmin Connection

Update `ConnectedDevicesViewModel`:
```kotlin
fun onGarminJustConnected() {
    // Show companion prompt if they don't have it
    if (!isCompanionAppInstalled()) {
        checkIfShouldShowCompanionPrompt(justConnected = true)
    }
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Test with just HR and GPS first. Add advanced metrics later.

### Tip 2: Use Garmin Forums
https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/

### Tip 3: Test on Multiple Devices
Borrow or buy used watches for testing (Forerunner 245 is cheap)

### Tip 4: Battery Life Matters
Stream data every 1-2 seconds, not every 100ms

### Tip 5: Fallback for No Connection
Watch should work standalone even if phone connection drops
